Hi! I'm currently a PhD candidate at [Optima Group](https://optima.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Hau-San Wong](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/cshswong/) and Prof. [Qingfu Zhang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qzhan7/index.html) since 2023 fall. I’m also fortunate to work closely with Prof. [Wei Huang](https://weihuang05.github.io) and Prof. [Andi Han](https://andihan3.github.io/). Before that, I completed my B.S in 2023 in Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong University, advised by Prof. [Hui Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BhgtoWMAAAAJ) and mentored by Prof. [Jian Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SSgNWOMAAAAJ&hl=En).

I'm currently an one-year intern at CFAR, A*STAR, where I'm supervised by Prof. [Atsushi Nitanda](https://sites.google.com/site/atsushinitanda/home). Prior to this, I spent one year (2024–2025) as a research intern at the University of Tokyo, working at the [Deep Learning Theory Team](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/deep_learn_theory/index.html) at RIKEN AIP under the supervision of Prof. [Taiji Suzuki](https://ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/suzuki/). Earlier, from January to May 2023, I was a research assistant in the [LOGO](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/LOGO.html) Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/).

My research broadly covers theoretical foundations of deep learning, distribution optimization, mean-field optimization, sampling, reinforcement learning and their applications.

You can find a full list of my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ja&user=mWrnNqsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
