I am currently a PhD candidate at Optima Group, Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Hau-San Wong and Prof. Qingfu Zhang since 2023 fall. I’m also fortunate to work closely with Prof. Wei Huang and Prof. Andi Han. Before that, I completed my bachelor degree in 2023 in Mathematics at Xi’an Jiaotong University, advised by Prof. Hui Li and mentored by Prof. Jian Sun.\nI am currently an incoming one-year intern at CFAR, A*STAR, where I will be supervised by Prof. Atsushi Nitanda. Prior to this, I spent one year (2024–2025) as a research intern at the University of Tokyo, working at the Deep Learning Theory Team at RIKEN AIP under the supervision of Prof. Taiji Suzuki. Earlier, from January to May 2023, I was a research assistant in the LOGO Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Tianshu Yu.\nMy research broadly covers theoretical foundations of deep learning, distribution optimization, mean-field optimization, sampling and reinforcement learning.\nYou can find a full list of my papers on Google Scholar."
