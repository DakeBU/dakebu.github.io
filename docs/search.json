I am currently a PhD candidate at Optima Group, Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. Hau-San Wong and Prof. Qingfu Zhang. I’m also fortunate to work with Prof. Wei Huang and Prof. Andi Han. Before that, I completed my bachelor degree in Mathematics at Xi’an Jiaotong University, advised by Prof. Hui Li.\nI am currently an incoming 1-year intern to CFAR, A*STAR, where I will be supervised by Prof. Atsushi Nitanda. Before that, I spent one year at the University of Tokyo as a member of the Deep Learning Theory Team, RIKEN AIP, advised by Prof. Taiji Suzuki.\nMy research broadly covers theoretical foundations of deep learning, distribution optimization, mean-field optimization, sampling and reinforcement learning.\nYou can find a full list of my papers on Google Scholar."
